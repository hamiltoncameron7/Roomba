<!-- two ngfors that go through the xArrays array of arrays and make buttons that report x and y back from point in array
neeeeed to figure out how to send those x and y that were clicked to the roomba component
also need to figure out roomba location on the grid and placing it properly and tracking
    for this, could move it to multiple locations and have it saved like 9 on the grid is 300px x translate

-->
<div class="buttHolder" *ngFor="let ite of xArrays; index as x;">
    <button class="butts" id="butts{{[x , i]}}" *ngFor="let item of ite; index as i;" (click)="addPoint(item, ite[x])"></button>
</div>
